# Airport Sales Management
This program uses Cassandra and MongoDB to tackle different problematics within an airport and its big data analysis. 

# Cassandra
Cassandra's system filters by month, travel reason and transit to use, in order to know the month in which the demand is higher, where travelers are going on vacation/leasure and also are considering rental car services.  
It also filters by connection flights where the wait time is higher than 100 minutes, and know the airpot where they're at. We need to know if customer services should be added based on this condition.  

# MongoDB
MongoDB's system filters each user by reason of stay, where business and hotel are priority.
